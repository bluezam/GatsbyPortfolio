    [FoodQ](https://foodq-react-prod.herokuapp.com/) was a project that applies real restaurant website applications. It features a waitlist application and phone notification. 

    It focused on using new and popular frontend and backend technologies such as React, GraphQL, Prisma, Twilio, Websockets and such. 
    
    This was a collaboration project between me and fellow cohorts [David Starr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-l-starr/) and Rachel Hollister.
